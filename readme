Hello 

This repo is an archive and will probably not be updated anymore.
The concept of this project is an indie video game : a mix betwen a rts and mmorpg.
If you interested i restarted a new one in 3D with opengl, contact me to participate.

some explanation about files that seem useless : 

ground.txt is the file where the ground is storred.
map.txt is the file where all objects are storred.
sons and img are the folder of used sound and images in games.
acounts.txt is where the logs are registered.

__compile__

for now the game is only compilable for linux.
dependencies: sdl2 library

There is 3 executable that you can compile  : 
server : make s
game : make
editmap : make e

__execute__

first the files ground.txt, map.txt and acounts.txt must be initialized.
editmap executable is made to initialize ground.txt.
acounts is by hand.
map.txt also and may be hard to understand. I advise to use and modify the one already providen.

once all the file are created (in the same folder that the server)
run ./serveur [port]
and with another terminal
./empireExpense
